### Personal information about github's request for carrying cookies
1. Self. Session_args: you need to enter your account password to run this project
2. The content requested in this project is my mailbox, and the information I want to obtain can be added in the function by myself, which has been noted in the project.

### Read/write to CSV file
1. Content collation from the network, code pro test available, infringement, please contact the author, delete

### Crawl the product information of jingdong and save it in CSV file
Thanks to xiao liu, xiao gou and xiao pang for their help
2. Comments are loaded by JS, so we need to send one more request
3. Get the train of thought: roughly analyze the web page, prepare cookie-> to obtain the source code of the web page -> xpath to obtain information, and return the list. At this time, it is found that the number of comments failed to obtain ->
To find the reason, request js-> to take out the number of comments -> saved to the CSV file
4. The code is incomplete, and it is late. I will write the rest later (some have been added).

### jd_shujufenxi
1. Crawled a comment of dong and displayed it on the front-end page
2. If no relevant data is found in the query database, the crawler script will be triggered to automatically crawl the relevant data and store it in the database

4. The front end rendering is very simple, just using the list (which is not that important, at least in my opinion for now)
